## T1

Transistor circuit shown below produces the accompanying truth table. The inputs to some of the gates of the transistors are not specified. Also, the outputs for some of the input combinations of the truth table are not specified. Complete both specifications. i.e., all transistors will have their gates properly labeled with either A, B, or C, and all rows of the truth table will have a 0 or 1 specified as the output.

## T2

Prove that NAND is logically complete.

## T3

Recall that the adder was built with individual **“slices”** that produced a sum bit and a carry-out bit based on the two operand bits A and B and the carry-in bit. We called such an element a full adder. Suppose we have a 3-to-8 decoder and two 6-input OR gates, as shown below. Can we connect them so that we have a full adder? If so, please do.

(Hint: If an input to an OR gate is not needed, we can simply put an input 0 on it and it will have no effect on anything. For example, see the following figure.)
